1. XFL

1.1 What is it?

	XFL is a reimplementation of Adobe Flash XFL and related things and GSAP library.

1.2 Why?

	I developed XFL while beeing hired to port a medium sized browser game frontend from Adobe Flash to OpenFL/Haxe. See "https://www.pirate-century.com". 

1.2 Who did this?

	XFL was programmed by Andreas Drewke at Pixel Racoons GmbH. Pixel Racoons allowed me to open source this! Thank you.
	XFL basic functionality like parsing was derived from "https://github.com/haxenme-old/xfl".

1.4 Notes

	This is not finished yet! And the code still looks ugly as I did all the things with time in mind. I will maybe clean it up later and document on things and such.
