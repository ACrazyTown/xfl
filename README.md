1. XFL

1.1 What is it?

	XFL is a leightweight implementation of Adobe Flash XFL and related things and GSAP library for Haxe/OpenFL.

1.2 Why?

	I am developing XFL while beeing hired to port a medium sized browser game frontend from Adobe Flash to OpenFL/Haxe. See "https://www.pirate-century.com". 

1.3 Who did this?

	XFL is beeing programmed by Andreas Drewke at Pixel Racoons GmbH. Pixel Racoons allows me to open source this! Thank you.
	XFL basic functionality like parsing was derived from "https://github.com/haxenme-old/xfl".

1.4 Notes

	This is not finished yet! And the code still looks ugly as I did all the things with time in mind. I will maybe clean it up later and document on things and such.
